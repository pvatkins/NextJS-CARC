    "Field Day is one of the biggest events in North American amateur radio. It runs " +
    "around the clock from start to finish on the fourth weekend of June every year. " +
    "More than 35,000 radio amateurs gather with their clubs, groups and friends to " +
    "operate from remote locations.",

    "The usual High Frequency (HF) amateur bands are 160, 80, 40, 20, 15, and 10 meters. " +
    "Amateur operations also occur in the VHF and UHF bands. Per the ARRL, the objective " +
    "of Field Day is: â€œTo work as many stations as possible on any and all amateur bands " +
    "(excluding the 60, 30, 17, and 12-meter bands) and to learn to operate in abnormal " +
    "situations in less than optimal conditions. Field Day is open to all amateurs in the " +
    "areas covered by the ARRL/RAC Field Organizations and countries within IARU Region 2. " +
    "DX stations residing in other regions may be contacted for credit, but are not " +
    "eligible to submit entries.",

    "The CARC will set up its Field Day operation on Sweeney Ridge near the Portola " +
    "Discovery Site (where the Gaspar de Portola expedition made the first European " +
    "discovery of SF Bay in 1769). The site has outstanding views of both the Pacific " +
    "Ocean and San Francisco Bay.",

    "Setup will commence at 8:00 AM at the Sneath Lane entrance to the park on " +
    "Saturday Morning, where hams from our club will trek up the hill to the " +
    "site. Setup consists of setting up the stations, especially the 15M and 20M beam " +
    "antennas.",

    "On-air operations will occur during " +
    "the 24-hour period between 11 AM on Saturday and 11 AM on Sunday. Following the " +
    "close of operations on Sunday, the stations will be disassembled and the site " +
    "cleared to its original pristine condition.",

    "You don't need to have HF privileges, or even be a ham, to make contacts at " +
    "our Field Day site. We will have personnel on hand to act as control operators. " +
    "So come on up and get involved in ham radio!"
